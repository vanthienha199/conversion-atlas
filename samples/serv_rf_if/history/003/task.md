## Task: Reset and Clock

Summary: Ensure proper clock and reset signals (if needed).

TL-Verilog works with a global (free-running) clock, called `clk`. If the Verilog code uses a clock by a different name, assign it to a new `clk` signal, and update the code to use `clk` instead. A module that is purely combinational may not have a clock, and this is okay. Just be aware that if any sequential logic is defined using TL-Verilog, SandPiper will assume a `clk` exists.

TL-Verilog code conventionally uses a positively-asserted synchronous reset signal, called `reset`, and FEV configurations may assume this name (not currently true, but we'll prepare for this in any case). If the module has a reset input, analyze the logic to determine its assertion level and whether it is synchronous or asynchronous. It's name and/or code comments may also be revealing. If there is no reset signal, none is needed, and this task is complete.

If there are any asynchronous uses of reset, the following changes will be needed that impact functionality and cannot be FEVed. At this point, that's okay. `feved.tlv` and `wip.tlv` should be unchanged from `prepared.sv`. Double check to be sure. If you do need to make a change, note that `prepared.sv` should be read-only now. You'll have to make it writable, and restore it to read-only when you are done. If the reset input is called `reset`, change its name in `prepared.sh` to `areset` (or `aresetn` if negatively asserted). Modify `prepared.sv` to synchronize the asynchronous reset using two flip-flops as a synchronizer, producing `reset` or `resetn`. Further update `prepared.sv` to use this new reset synchronously. Copy changes to `feved.tlv` and `wip.tlv`. Update `tracker.md` to highlight these unFEVed changes in `prepared.sv`.

If the input reset signal is negatively asserted, create an internal positively-asserted reset. This can be done in `wip.tlv` as it will not impact behavior. Call this positively-asserted reset `reset`. Update all uses of the old reset to use this new one.

Unless you had to establish a new baseline `prepared.sv` model, there should be no interface changes for this (or any subsequent) task. `reset` can be created from the reset input as an internal signal, not by changing the interface.
